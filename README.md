Whack-a-Mole Game (Prototype)
A simple prototype of the classic Whack-a-Mole game built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Electron. This is an early-stage version, and there are plenty of areas for improvement and polish. It’s a fun project to play with, but it's not yet the final version!

Description
This project is a prototype of the Whack-a-Mole game, where players need to click on moles that pop up randomly within a grid of holes. The game is built using basic web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and packaged as a desktop application using Electron.

Current Features (Prototype)
A grid of holes where moles randomly appear.

Basic gameplay where players "whack" moles by clicking on them.

Score tracking for each successful whack.

Basic game timer counting down.

Areas for Improvement:
Graphics & Animation: The current visuals and animations are basic. There's room to improve the design and make the moles pop up in a more dynamic way.

Sound Effects: Sound effects for whacking, mole popping, and winning/losing would enhance the game.

Timer and Difficulty: The game has a basic timer, but a difficulty scaling system based on time or player score could be added.

Mobile Optimization: The game is not yet optimized for mobile play. Mobile-friendly layout and controls are needed.

High Score System: Adding a way to save high scores locally or on a server would be a great improvement.

Bug Fixes: Some gameplay bugs might be present, and there's a need for thorough testing and debugging.
